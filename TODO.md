# TODO

## High priority

* aquatic_ws
  * Validate SDP data

## Medium priority

* stagger cleaning tasks?
* Run cargo-fuzz on protocol crates

* udp 
  * support link to arbitrary homepage as well as embedded tracker URL in statistics page
  * Non-trivial dependency updates
    * toml v0.7
    * syn v2.0

* quit whole program if any thread panics
  * But it would be nice not to panic in workers, but to return errors instead.
    Once JoinHandle::is_finished is available in stable Rust (#90470), an
    option would be to
     * Save JoinHandles
     * When preparing to quit because of PanicSentinel sending SIGTERM, loop
       through them, extract error and log it

* Run cargo-deny in CI

* aquatic_ws
  * Add cleaning task for ConnectionHandle.announced_info_hashes?
  * RES memory still high after traffic stops, even if torrent maps and connection slabs go down to 0 len and capacity
    * replacing indexmap_amortized / simd_json with equivalents doesn't help
  * SinkExt::send maybe doesn't wake up properly?
    * related to https://github.com/sdroege/async-tungstenite/blob/master/src/compat.rs#L18 ?

* Performance hyperoptimization (receive interrupts on correct core)
  * If there is no network card RSS support, do eBPF XDP CpuMap redirect based on packet info, to
    cpus where socket workers run. Support is work in progress in the larger Rust eBPF
    implementations, but exists in rebpf
  * Pin socket workers
  * Set SO_INCOMING_CPU (which should be fixed in very recent Linux?) to currently pinned thread
  * How does this relate to (currently unused) so_attach_reuseport_cbpf code?

## Low priority

* aquatic_udp
  * udp uring
    * miri
    * thiserror?
    * CI
    * uring load test?
  * what poll event capacity is actually needed?
  * load test
      * move additional request sending to for each received response, maybe
        with probability 0.2

* aquatic_ws
  * large amount of temporary allocations in serialize_20_bytes, pretty many in deserialize_20_bytes
    * 20 byte parsing: consider using something like ArrayString<80> to avoid
      heap allocations

# Not important

* aquatic_http:
  * consider better error type for request parsing, so that better error
    messages can be sent back (e.g., "full scrapes are not supported")
  * test torrent transfer with real clients
    * scrape: does it work (serialization etc), and with multiple hashes?
    * 'left' optional in magnet requests? Probably not. Transmission sends huge
      positive number.

# Don't do

* general: PGO didn't seem to help way back

## aquatic_http
* request from path:
  * deserialize 20 bytes: possibly rewrite (just check length of underlying
    bytes == 20 and then copy them), also maybe remove String from map for
    these cases too. doesn't really improve performance
  * crazy http parsing: check for newline with memchr, take slice until
    there. then iter over space newlines/just take relevant data. Not faster
    than httparse and a lot worse

## aquatic_udp_protocol
* Use `bytes` crate: seems to worsen performance somewhat
* Zerocopy (https://docs.rs/zerocopy/0.3.0/zerocopy/index.html) for requests
  and responses. Doesn't improve performance
