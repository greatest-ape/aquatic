# aquatic: high-performance open BitTorrent tracker

[![CI](https://github.com/greatest-ape/aquatic/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/greatest-ape/aquatic/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

High-performance open BitTorrent tracker, consisting
of sub-implementations for different protocols:

[aquatic_udp]: ./crates/udp
[aquatic_http]: ./crates/http
[aquatic_ws]: ./crates/ws

| Name           | Protocol                        | OS requirements |
|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| [aquatic_udp]  | BitTorrent over UDP             | Unix-like       |
| [aquatic_http] | BitTorrent over HTTP over TLS   | Linux 5.8+      |
| [aquatic_ws]   | WebTorrent, optionally over TLS | Linux 5.8+      |

Features at a glance:

- Multithreaded design for handling large amounts of traffic
- All data is stored in-memory (no database needed)
- IPv4 and IPv6 support
- Supports forbidding/allowing info hashes
- Prometheus metrics
- Automated CI testing of full file transfers

Known users:

- [explodie.org public tracker](https://explodie.org/opentracker.html) (`udp://explodie.org:6969`), typically [serving ~100,000 requests per second](https://explodie.org/tracker-stats.html)
